            <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
   <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous,[1] terrestrial great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of 
    equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western
    gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans,
    from 96 to 99% depending on what is included,
    and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees.</p>

   <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 m 
    (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and 270 kg (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6
    m (8 ft 6 in), depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being 
    called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur 
    colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years in the wild.</p>

   <P>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa.
    Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range 
    of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga
    Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 m (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in
    dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas 
    living in Central West African countries and eastern
    lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.</P>

   <p><strong>Where will you find them?</strong></p>
   <p>Gorillas live in the tropical forests of central Africa. There are two main species: 
    western gorillas and eastern gorillas, which are separated by the Congo Basin forest. 
    Eastern gorillas are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Rwanda.
    Western gorillas are found in Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
    the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo. </p>
