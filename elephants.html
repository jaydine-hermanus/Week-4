            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals.
                Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana),
                the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
                They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; 
                extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.
                Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks,
                large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin.
                The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. 
                Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving 
                objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as 
                well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs
                whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>

                <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found
                in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. 
                they are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible.
                They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments.
                Elephants have a fission fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together
                to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with
                her calves or several related females with offspring. 
                The leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.</p>

                <p>Elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world.  
                In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks.
                The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo  who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey
                Circus.[166][167] These animals do not reproduce well in captivity due to the difficulty of handling
                musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more
                common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses.
                After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, imports of the species almost stopped
                by the end of the 1980s. Subsequently,
                the US received many captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.</p>

                <p><strong>Where will you find them?</strong></p>
                <p>Elephants are found in two main regions: sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia.
                In Africa, they inhabit various habitats like savannahs, forests, and even deserts. In Asia,
                they are found in similar environments,
                including grasslands, forests, and wetlands. </p>
