            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
   <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
    It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally,
    giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
    Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research into 
    their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. 
    Six valid extinct species of Giraffa from Africa and Pakistan are known from the fossil record.</p>

   <p>The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like 
    ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its
    closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South
    Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit
    savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, 
    primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.</p>
    
   <P>Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes.
    Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult
    males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups. Males establish social hierarchies through
    "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
    Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.</P>
   </br>
   <p><strong>Where will you find them?</strong></p>
   <p>Giraffes are native to Africa and live in a variety of habitats, including savannas and woodlands.
    They are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, from 
    Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. </p>
