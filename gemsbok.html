            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
   <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx.
     It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of)
     Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. Previously,
     some sources classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>

   <p>Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump.
     Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge
    of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the
    blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have 
    white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long,
    straight horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch at the base of the tail, has
    less black on the legs (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks. One very rare
    color morph is the "golden oryx",
    in which the gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.</p>

   <P>Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m (4 ft) at the shoulder.
    [7][8] The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm 
    (18 to 35 in).[9] Male gemsbok 
    can weigh between 180 and 240 kg,400 and 530 lb, while females weigh 100 to 210 kg 220 to 460 lb.</P>

   <p><strong>Where will you find them?</strong></p>
   <p>Gemsbok, also known as the oryx gazelle, are primarily found in the desert and arid regions of 
    Southern Africa, specifically the Kalahari and Namib deserts. They can also be spotted in national 
    parks and game reserves throughout the area, 
    like the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Gemsbok National Park. </p>
